### Deploying to GitHub Pages

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when you push to the `main` branch.

**Setup Steps:**

1. Go to your repository settings on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Pages** (under "Code and automation")
3. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
4. Push your changes to the `main` branch
5. The game will be automatically deployed to: `https://ceruleanoak.github.io/hanafuda/`

The deployment workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

## How to Play

1. **Your Turn**: Click a card from your hand (bottom row)
2. **Match or Place**:
   - Click a matching field card (same month) to capture both
   - Or click your selected card again to place it on the field
3. **Draw Phase**: A card is automatically drawn from the deck
   - If it matches a field card, both are captured automatically
   - Otherwise, it's placed on the field
4. **Scoring**: Form yaku (combinations) to earn points
5. **Round End**: The round ends when all cards are played

## Card Images

To use custom card images instead of placeholders:

1. **Recommended format**: PNG with transparency
2. **Recommended size**: 200-400px width, 300-600px height
3. **File naming**: Use the card names from `src/data/cards.js`
4. **Location**: Place images in `assets/cards/`

Example: `January - bright - crane.png`

## Background Textures

To add a custom background:

1. **Recommended formats**: JPEG or WebP for large textures
2. **Location**: Place in `assets/backgrounds/`
3. **Usage**: Uncomment and modify in `src/main.js`:

```javascript
game.loadBackground('./assets/backgrounds/your-texture.jpg');
```
