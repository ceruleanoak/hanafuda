# Card Backs

Place card back images in this folder.

## File Naming Convention
- Each card back should be a PNG file
- Recommended size: 100x140 pixels (matching card dimensions)
- Example names: `default.png`, `sakura.png`, `koi.png`, etc.

## Default Card Back
A placeholder `default.png` will be used until custom card backs are added.
